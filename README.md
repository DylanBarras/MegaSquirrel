# Squirrel (WIP)
This is a project for the class Software Engineering (CS-390) at Coe College with professor Stephen Hughes, in collaboration with Jesse Ellis.

## Main Goal
The goal for this project is to develop a way to allow students at Coe College to participate in a "community science experiment". Our goal is to develop a cross-platform mobile app and a companion website that will allow users to capture images and data about squirrels around Coe's campus. The users will then be able to log in and see others' images and keep track of the squirrels.
